Tell me in [issues](https://github.com/happymimimix/ntvdmx64-PreBuilt/issues) if there's a new version and want me to update it. 

If you want to build it yourself, [here](https://archive.org/download/NTVDMx64-Resources) is a collection of all of the leaked windows source codes that you'll need to create a working binary build of NTVDMx64.
